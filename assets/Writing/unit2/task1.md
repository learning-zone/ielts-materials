#UNIT AIMS

In this unit, you will learn:

* how to identify different types of visuals
* how to describe the topic of visuals
* how to describe the main features shown in visuals
* how to write overview paragraphs describing visuals (summarise the key information)

###Introduction to Writing Task 1: Visuals

Types of Visuals
* bar chart
* pie chart
* line graph
* table
* diagram
* flow chart
* map

Data about many topics are often given in a visual format, for example weather patterns, sales reports, or population statistics. 

__Remember that you will need to write 150 words for Task 1__

When analyzing the data, the frist thing you need to do is look at the tittle of the visual.

If you are given a __Bar chart__, identify the two axis and what they represent, then look if the graph has several bar sets (generally represented by colors)...

If the graph is a __Pie chart__, realize that the whole pie represents 100% of something, so identify the large pieces and then the smaller pieces of the chart.

The __Line chart__ is used to show changes over time. Like the bar chart, this visual also has two axes. First, we should read what each of the lines represent. Analyze the behaviour, but keep it to the facts, you might be tempted at this point to speculate as to the reasons why this change has occurred, but do not do this. In Task 1 of the IELTS Academic Writing Test you are simply required to describe the data that is presented in the visual. The task does not require you to give your opinions or to speculate about the data.

Next, we’ll look at a __Table__. With this type of data, you would need to use the past tense when you discuss the information, as these dates are in the past. Sometimes you are given a date in the future, like 2050 for example, and you would need to use future verb forms to discuss those figures.

Remember, we should not make any comment about the reasons why this change has occurred because no data about that is given in the table.

In the next type of visual, __Diagrams__, you will see a combination of words and pictures. 
It is usual for diagrams to progress from left to right, or from top to bottom.
This diagram shows how something is produced at any time, so you should use the present tense to show general time.

The next type of visual we’ll look at is actually quite similar to the diagram. It’s the __Flow chart__. With this, we see the process of how something works or is produced, so we can expect to see arrows as well as words and pictures.
Again, we’ll start from the left of the flow chart and follow the arrows to the right of the page. 
This flow chart describes a process that happens in general time, so you would use the present tense to write about it.

You are probably very familiar with the last type of visual that you might be given in
Task 1 of the Writing Test. It’s a __Map__. With this type of visual you need to describe
the location of places in relation to other places. This means you’ll use __**prepositions**__.
It’s worth pointing out that you may be given two maps to describe in this task. For
example, you might have to compare two maps of the same area, one from 1980 and one from
2010, and describe the changes that have occurred over that time.

As it was mentioned earlier, when we where talking about maps, sometimes you will be 
given two related visuals to describe. You’ll need to choose the important features of both visuals and
say how they are related.
To write the response, first you would describe one graph, and then the other. At the end, you
would write one or two sentences to show how they are related. We’ll look at this more
closely later in the unit.

###Other resource
[IELTS Writing Task 1 - What to write!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK_PE9ILJjQ)

* You should write 170 - 190 words
* Introduction: 1 or 2 sentences, if you write more your are talking too much.
* The introduction should focus on "what i am lookking at?"
* Never should use the words: I, me, we (this taks is about the visual, not about the writer)
* No opinions, no conclusion, no analysis, no explanation
* Just provide facts, no meaning of the facts
* This is an English test, not an inteligence test, you do not need to understand what information is provided.
* Keep it simple (special the introduction)
* Again __No conclusion!!!__

###Report Body
* Pay attention to your axes, the units, the range
* Mention peaks and valleys, or the stability, or the __plateau__
* Look for patterns, trends but keep it general
* Then, look for the anomalies (or exceptions), and give some details
* If you have __Tables__, pay attention of the heading 
* If you are looking at a __Diagram__, indentify the start, the finish, and the major steps (milestone)
* When you are comparing, look for similarities and differences but spend more time in the differences

###How split your paragraphs
* There is no rule, you have to figure it out
* A good idea is to have 2 or 3 paragraphs, where the first is for a brief introduction
* __If you have one chart__, you can take one paragraph for the trends and the other for the anomalies
* Or you can focus on one thing (item of the visual), and leave the other paragraph for the other item
* __If you have two charts__, first paragraph talk about chart one, and in the second one talk about the other chart
* Or, you can talk about the similarities on the first paragraph and then talk about the major differences. Here you have to make so sort of connetion, but dont go beyond the informatcion given to you
* If you have a __Diagram__ or a __Flow chart__, you can explain everthing in just one paragraphs

###SUMMARY: HOW TO DO TASK 1 QUESTIONS

Task 1 questions always have the same parts. Here is an example:

> You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.
>
> The chart below show total numbers of visitor to Australia as well as the tourist revenue received from six countries.
>
> Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.
>
> Write at least 150 words

The first part of the question reminds you, you should spend about 20 minutes writing
your response; and the last part here reminds you that you need to write at least 150 words.

___There are always two other paragraphs___. The first one will give you a sentence about the
visual or visuals that you are going to describe.

The next paragraph tells you what you have to do. It will contain one or more verbs.

* ___Step 1___: Read the instructions carefully.

* ___Step 2___: Check the time that you begin Writing Task 1 and allow 20 minutes only.

* ___Step 3___: Read the first paragraph and quickly scan the visual(s).

* ___Step 4___: Read the second paragraph and underline the verbs. These tell you what to write about.

* ___Step 5___: Write your response in at least 150 words.



###UNDERSTANDING TASK 1 QUESTIONS PRACTICE: VISUAL 1

Read the writing task below and study the visual carefully:

![TASK 1 - VISUAL 1](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/c031e5c4dc408a6eb71c7042b40c1d73/asset-v1:UQx+IELTSx+3T2015+type@asset+block/Writing_-_understanding_task_1_qs_-_global_electricity_writing_task.PNG)

___Now you will need to summarise the visual by completing the sentence below___. Remember, try to paraphrase the language 
used in the question rubric (when you can), rather than copying.


###Topic and Overview

Two important things you need to include in your Task 1 answer; a sentence to introduce the topic of the visual, and an overview. 

###Topic
To begin your answer, you need to write one or two sentences that introduce the general
topic of the visual and explain the type of information that it shows. 

Therefore, to introduce the general topic
of the visual, and explain the type of information that it shows, you need to paraphrase the description given in the question.
Here, by paraphrasing, the candidate has shown the examiner that they have understood the
information correctly and that they have some range in terms of ___vocabulary___ and ___grammar___.

Think about ways that you could paraphrase this sentence
Instead of the word ‘chart’, you could use ‘graph’. Instead of ‘shows’, you
could use ‘illustrates’, ‘gives an overview of’, or ‘gives information about’. Instead
of ‘proportions’, you could use ‘percentages’. And finally, instead of the word ‘annually’,
you could use 'in one year’.


###Overview
* one or two
* describes the main trend(s)
* at the beginning (after the introductory sentence) or at the end
* It so important, that maybe is a good idea to write it at the beginning.
