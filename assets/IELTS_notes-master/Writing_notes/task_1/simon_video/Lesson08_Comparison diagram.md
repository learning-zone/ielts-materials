## Introduction

> The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.

The two pictures compare the **current layout** of the ground floor of a house with a **plan to redesign** the same living space.

## Overview

We can see that the new **design proposal** **involves** making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.

## Details

**The most noticeable change** **from** the existing **to** the proposed floor plan **is that** **there will no longer be** a separate hall area when the building work **has been done**. **This will be** **achieved by** removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current *staircase* and *under-stair storage cupboard*. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also **contain** the staircase to the first floor.

**To replace** the current straight staircase, a new set of *winding stairs* **will be installed** in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen **will** also **be replaced with** double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. **Finally**, the planned building work **will** also **include** the installation of some *kitchen furniture*.
