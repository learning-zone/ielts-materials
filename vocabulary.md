## IELTS speaking part 1 - sample questions and answers

#### Examiner: Do you come from a large family?

Answer: My immediate family is not very big. I have a large extended family that includes many uncles, aunts, and cousins. We are a close-knit family, and we like to keep in touch with one another, so birthdays, and other celebrations, are noisy crowded affairs.

</div>

#### Examiner: When was the last time you had a family function?

Answer: Our extended family got together last year to celebrate my grandfather\'s eightieth birthday. He is very dear to my heart. He has kept up healthy relationships with the whole family, so it was a happy occasion that we all enjoyed.

#### Examiner: Would you take a friend on a family holiday?

Answer: I have. My family and my best friend got to know each other quite well, as she visited me quite frequently at my home. My family believes that we should nurture our friendships, so they encouraged me to bring my friend along when we took a seaside holiday last year.

## IELTS speaking part 2 - sample question and answer

#### Examiner: Tell me about your best friend.

To answer this question in full,

discuss who the person is,
the circumstances of your meeting,
and what it is that you like about them.

Answer: My best friend and I got to know each other when we were still very young. We lived in neighbouring houses. We had a lot in common, so we soon hit it off.

As we have grown older, we have moved apart. Because of this, we have to some degree lost touch, but anyone who has had a lifelong friend would understand that she will always be dear to my heart.

When we do find ourselves in the same city, we arrange a dinner date, so that we can enjoy each other\'s company. We share the same ideas, and we share a common background.

We enjoy reminiscing about our past exploits. When we struck up a friendship, as children, we were inseparable. In those early days, we built up a relationship of trust that time and distance cannot break.

## IELTS speaking part 3 - sample questions and answers

#### Examiner: Do you think that after-hour friendships between working colleagues are appropriate?

Answer: I think that it is important to have a good working relationship. Colleagues should extend the hand of friendship to newcomers in the workplace. I don\'t believe, however, that professional relationships should extend into the domestic domain as this may affect office politics.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: Do you think that social media is changing the way that we relate to our friends and family?

Answer: In some ways yes. Social media allows us to build up relationships with distant cousins, even with those that live on foreign soil. It also helps us to make connections with long lost friends, who we may never have spoken to or seen again. On the other hand, we often spend far too much time on our digital devices instead of socializing face to face.

<div align="right">

</div>

#### Examiner: Do you think that people who enter into a long-term relationship, should continue with their friendships from their single days?

Answer: I think that it is important to nurture our friendships whether or not we are in a long-term relationship. Not all relationships stand the test of time, and if you have relationship problems you may one day need a shoulder to cry on. In my view, too many people abandon their friends when they become involved in relationships.

## Examples of IELTS speaking part 1 questions

#### Examiner: What food do you like to eat?

Answer: I am not a fussy eater. As long as you don\'t feed me rabbit food I\'m easy to please. My flatmate and I share the cooking chores. Once a week we make a slap-up meal of steak and chips covered in a rich sauce and to satisfy the sweet tooth we finish off with a decadent chocolate pudding.

<div align="right">

</div>

#### Examiner: So, do you enjoy cooking?

Answer: I prefer eating to cooking. I make good use of ready meals and I am not averse to junk food or the occasional pub lunch. I realize though that it is necessary to include nutritious food in my diet, which is why I cook several times a week.

#### Examiner: What is your favourite meal of the day?

Answer: I\'m a breakfast fan. I wake up starving hungry after a good night\'s sleep. I like nothing better than a good English breakfast of bacon, eggs, and buttery toast, along with a piping hot cup of coffee.

## IELTS speaking part 2 question

#### Examiner: Tell me about your favourite restaurant

In this question, you should discuss

the restaurant that you like best,
why you like it,
and the occasions when you go there.
Answer: I enjoy fine dining and exotic food. Both are available at my favourite restaurant in the centre of town. On special occasions I take my partner wining and dining. We love the ambience of the candle-lit dinners, and the extensive menu of mouth-watering meals.

The menu includes starters, mains and deserts. Usually by the time we get there I am dying of hunger so we order a starter to calm the hunger pangs. We usually also share a bottle of bubbly. It is after all a celebration. Having finished our starter we take our time, savouring the food.

This is not the type of restaurant where you would ask for a doggy bag, so we waste nothing. We end the evening with a delicious dessert. After settling the bill, we head off home, satisfied that we have enjoyed a scrumptious meal.

## IELTS speaking part 3 questions

#### Examiner: Do you believe that the 21st Century diet is a healthy one?

Answer: Far too many people are overweight. I believe that people should cut down on sugars and refined carbohydrates and replace them with leafy vegetables and seasonal fruits. A balanced diet would help them to regulate their weight.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: Starvation is a problem in many parts of the world. What do you think should be done about it?

Answer: From what I\'ve read current global food production can cover the daily consumption needs of the world. We need to find a way to economically transport it to where it is most needed or find alternate food sources. Nobody should starve when there is no shortage of food.

<div align="right">

</div>

#### Examiner: In homes where both parents work do you think cooking has become just another job at the end of the day?

Answer: I know that food preparation can be time-consuming, but if everyone helps with ideas and recipes and everyone takes a turn and lends a hand, cooking can be fun for the family. Home cooked meals are also often healthier and packed with vitamins.

#### Examiner: What are your favourite holiday pastimes?

Answer: I like to get away from it all. I look for exotic destinations with scenic views that are off the beaten track. I tend to avoid guided tours and packaged deals as I prefer to go sightseeing on my own.

## Part 2 style questions

#### Examiner: Describe one of your best travel experiences.

This type of question supports a when, where and who reply.

Answer: Last year a friend and I took a long-haul flight to Peru. We were travelling light so we were able to really get around. We stayed in quaint villages and hiked through lush rainforests. We were determined to do as the locals do, so we stayed with local people for part of the trip.

We visited colourful craft markets and brought back souvenirs, to remind us of our trip. One of my most memorable experiences was to the Sacred Valley of the Incas. It is a little bit off the beaten track but it is surrounded by great scenic beauty and magnificent landscapes.

## Part 3 style questions

#### Examiner: What type of holiday destination do you think attracts most tourists?

Answer: I know that many people are drawn to wildlife safaris. This is certainly one of the big attractions in Africa. In Europe and Asia, the stunning architecture, museums and arts and culture attract thousands of tourists every year.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: Do you think that the tourism industry will continue to grow in the next two decades?

Answer: I do. Many European and Asian countries have aging populations who will have time on their hands in the future. Many of them are likely to seek holiday destinations around the world. Today there are many affordable destinations that offer good value for money.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: What do you think that your country could do to attract more tourists?

Answer: My country has stringent visa regulations. If these were relaxed, I think that more visitors would choose to visit. We have an efficient public transport, plenty of accommodation and natural and historical places of interest.

I am computer literate. I study from home and I need Internet access to do my research. Advances in technology have also made it possible for me to work from home. I surf the web in search of freelance opportunities.

In my leisure time, I download books and music from the Internet. I pay for these via Electronic Funds Transfer. I do not condone online piracy, as I value the arts and believe that the authors and songwriters should be rewarded for their work.

I use social media networks to keep up with my friends and family across the globe and I also shop online from time to time.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

## Part 3 questions

#### Do you think that there are any disadvantages to modern technology?

Answer: I think that there are several disadvantages. Security can be a problem with people hacking into the Internet. Also, modern technology tends to become rapidly obsolete so we become more and more a throw-away society. People are also losing physical contact with one another as they become glued to their screens.

In what ways do you think people will benefit from technologies in the future?

Answer: Emerging technology has the capacity to change our lives in so many ways. Robots and artificial intelligence are both reducing the amount of tedious work required in a wide range of industries and professions. We can now also get expert advice from across the globe using an internet connection.

In your opinion what are the basic computer skills that every person should have today?

Answer: All the information we require is available on the Internet, so everyone should be able to boot up a computer, log in and know how to use a search engine. Everyone should have access to the Internet so that they can surf the web.

</div>

## IELTS speaking part 1 style questions

#### Examiner: Has there been an increase in pollution where you live?

Georgio: Yes, there has been a dramatic increase in recent years as many of the most productive factories are built on the outskirts of large towns and some are even in quite central areas so very near where people live. Air pollution, as a result of factory emissions and toxic fumes has become a real problem.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: How has this pollution had an impact on daily life, do you think?

Helena: I think there are two key areas which have been most affected – firstly, our health, as air pollution is terrible in the city centre because too many workers commute and rely heavily on their cars rather than travelling by public transport and there are many traffic jams. Secondly, on the quality of crops and in rural areas, where the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in farming has contributed to a dangerous amount of pollutants in foods.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: Are residents in your town good at recycling? 

Sara: Sadly, in my opinion, not nearly good enough. I know in many European countries, the mantra of reuse and recycle plastics and cardboards has become automatic but here there is still a culture of throwing everything away and most domestic as well as industrial waste is incinerated. Obviously, this policy just contributes to worsening air pollution and to plastic being thrown into the sea.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

## IELTS speaking part 2 style question

#### Describe a time when you have caused pollution,

You should say:

When this was
What it was
Where it was
And the impact which you think this might have caused.

Zoe: I would like to describe a moment when I was on holiday a few years ago in a really beautiful part of India on holiday with a group of friends. We had been travelling around India for a month and I think I had adjusted to seeing a huge amount of waste on the streets. Not surprisingly, there were very limited facilities for recycling – this is not really part of the culture and it would require a huge investment to put in place the equipment and education programme needed.

We were travelling on a train and had been sleeping as it was a very long journey and early the next morning when we pulled into the station, everyone leaned out of the window and purchased bottles of water, cups of tea and hot food from excited street sellers on the platforms.

I was happy to join in with the locals and without even thinking drank my water then threw the bottle back out of the window which is something I would never have done back home. It wasn\'t until later that I understood the consequences of this action.

After winding through the countryside for hours, the train finally reached the coast. I was stunned – rather than a beautiful, clear blue stretch of ocean, all I could see was plastic waste – bottles, bags, food packaging as well as larger items of industrial items were just floating, interspersed with a few seabirds who looked utterly confused and were not really able to swim.

I could clearly see the impact of my careless action on the train and the problem of plastics in the ocean became horribly evident. With no other way of disposing of rubbish, the temptation, indeed, the default had become to simply throw bottles and bags on the ground or into the sea, river or lake and so much of this has ended up in the ocean. Since then I have been rigorous about waste and campaigned to make sure my local town has widely available recycling bins for all.

</div>

## IELTS speaking part 3 style questions

#### Examiner: What should be done about plastic in the ocean?

Emanuel: While quite a lot has been done already to highlight this terrible problem, I think more could be done to make sure the public know the dangers. Apparently around 350 million tonnes of plastic are being produced each year and around 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year.

If waste management practices don't improve, scientists predict this amount could increase tenfold by 2025. What happens is that while paper will eventually disintegrate, plastic does not do this and so when it does eventually break up, it still leaves smaller fragments called microplastics, which have been identified in commercial fish consumed by humans.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: What might some solutions be to reduce this situation?

Alexi: I think many manufactures should work really hard to reduce the use of what is called single-use applications, plastics which are used just once and then disposed of as this makes up approximately half of all plastics. Plastic can quite easily be recycled and used again for shampoo bottles for example. Some large companies have already started only using recycled plastics for their own- brand products and this kind of policy should be rolled out as widely as possible.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: What would you say to children who are faced with this problem for the future?

Benji: I would try to encourage teachers and parents to explain the situation to youngsters but also to try and be positive about what can be done. Firstly, we all need to be much more careful about recycling which is not impossible and should start at school as well as in the home.

There have been many incredible documentaries informing us all about the global plastic problem and awareness is a very important stage in beginning to stop the problem. I am not sure what is being done at the moment to remove this mass of plastic but we must make sure we do not make this worse, and we protect our planet as well as the wildlife and birds and we should protect the next generation who will also have to try to find solutions.

#### Examiner:  Do you enjoy meeting new people?

Minna: Yes, I do, but I admit that it does depend on the context. For example, if I am with a group of life long friends as well, I feel more confident and relaxed than if I am alone, when I feel more timid and awkward.

I think that at work I try to put up a façade of being professional and in control although underneath the surface I am paddling like a swan.

#### Examiner: Would you describe yourself as a sociable person?

Mario: I\'d like to say so, as I am always happy to get involved in organising parties and gatherings – indeed I can be a bit of a control freak, as I have an eye for detail. However, I would be more than delighted to be described as reliable and dependable as we all need friends we can rely on.

I have known my best friends since school, and we trust each other completely and pick up where we left off each time we see each other.

Judy:  That\'s a great question! Every year I make a resolution to be on time for both work and social meetings, but I have a terrible habit of always being slightly late.

I know that punctuality is a virtue and I am always embarrassed by being a bad time keeper, especially when I understand that being late is rude and disrespectful. I will keep working on improving this negative trait.

IELTS speaking part 2 - Style question
Describe a person you would like to be similar to. You should say

• Who this person is?

• What this person does?

• What qualities this person has and explain why you would like to be similar to this person?

Edin: I\'d like to talk about a teacher who is Head of Pastoral care at a school I used to go to. Pastoral duties revolve around the mental and social health of students more than the academic side but of course, the two work in tandem.

This lady, Mrs Butler, has held this job for more than a decade, and she is inspiring in her attention to detail and caring personality.

It is her job to interact with students, in a relaxed, almost parental way and create the kind of atmosphere where they can trust her, and share any problems and issues they may have.

As part of her duties, she would liaise between the students and other members of staff, education, and healthcare professional bodies, and parents as needed.

The interpersonal and communication skills required for this role are very demanding  and take a long time to learn if not acquired naturally.

Mrs. Butler is enormously empathetic, she really understands emotion and is a great and generous listener and I believe these are all key qualities that are important to emulate.

I think that interacting with students and colleagues at work can present many challenges and an understanding of human characteristics, even the psychology, of how people think and respond to each other is more and more important.

I would love to be considered as caring, considerate, and reliable as she is and she is really one of those rare people who can connect with anyone, anywhere.

Sergi: It is often said that men can be more opinionated and less empathetic than women and it is true that this is often a male stereotype.

#### Examiner: How do companies try to assess the personalities of people who are applying for jobs?

Alice: Rather than a traditional interview nowadays, many companies demand high grades in psychometric tests which have been designed to test character in order to select candidates who are compatible with the company mentality.

Aloic: In my opinion, these tests are used to save time as most jobs today attract numerous applicants and it must be hard to choose the strongest and most suitable.

IELTS speaking part 2 style question
Describe a change you have made to benefit your own healthy lifestyle

You should say:

What it is
Why you decided to do it
How you have benefitted from it
and explain why you would recommend it to others
Diana: I have always been interested in Health, Diet and Nutrition as I am aware that this is extremely important to function successfully, sleep well and to prevent illness. I have been tempted by diets over the years, but my determination usually fluctuates quite a lot and they can be pretty boring, as well as rigorous. However, recently one of my flatmates adopted a vegan diet and, because we share a kitchen, I decided to be as broad minded as possible and learn from her!

There\'s been a lot of stuff in the media about how unhealthy it is to eat too much meat, especially red meat and processed meat. I was already fairly healthy and ate a balanced diet, but when I started to read about veganism and the potential benefits of eating meat, I was hooked and determined to make some changes myself.

In fact, I recently watched a documentary on Netflix about a professional sportsman who was even more successful after becoming vegan, and this was revealing and surprising, as I had imagined that he would have needed vast quantities of meat to be strong. (note – grammar third conditional which is quite unusual!)

At first, the cooking was both time consuming and challenging, involving a vast range of new ingredients, techniques and recipe books, but it was fun at the same time, and our kitchen soon became a hub of not just friends but delicious odours!

After a few months, I decided to make this change and, whilst I do occasionally miss not enjoying a large steak, I feel healthier, have lost weight, feel energised and much more alert at work. I know too that have cut down my risk of serious disease such as a stroke or heart attack and this is reassuring.

I would definitely recommend cutting down on red meat and processed food to all my friends, even those who are rather sceptical about vegans and argue that this diet is too complicated and limited. We all know that the over production of meat is damaging to the environment and as an added bonus,  being partly vegan  has definitely saved me money as the price of meat has risen steadily  in price over the past few years.

#### Examiner: Do you think more could be done to encourage health in your country?

Edurne: I think, in my country that the policy makers should have more initiatives and implement stricter policies when it comes to activities that affect people\'s health. For example, the banning of smoking in public places would not just benefit the smokers, but the non-smokers as well as there is much evidence about the dangers of passive smoking and air pollution. Also, there is a well-established link between better education and health care so education in school is important.

#### Examiner: How can individuals take more responsibility for their own health?

Andre: For me, this links back to education which should really start at school and then continue throughout one\'s life. The more we look after ourselves and make the correct decisions surrounding food, health, exercise and so on, the less we might need from our overstretched health services and hospitals. 

For example, campaigns to eat less sugar, cut down on fizzy drinks and sugary snacks, and eat more fruit have been very successful recently and by educating the young, they, in turn, will influence their own families increase their vegetable and fruit intake.

#### Examiner: What could be done to halt the rise of obesity globally?

Raff: In my opinion the government has a huge responsibility to try to persuade people to live more healthily and the rise of obesity or overweight children as well as adults is very worrying. It is very distressing to see young children in pushchairs being given cans of fizzy drinks and sweets as a reward to good behaviour.

As well as education in school, governments could educate adults through as series of TV programmes, magazine adverts or public service education messages to raise awareness of the risk and dangers of obesity and a poor diet. A positive reinforcement message would be more effective than more negative messaging. For example, free gym membership, recipe cards and access to more playing fields, parks and green spaces which would contribute to making exercise not only accessible but fun too!

## IELTS speaking part 2 – style question

#### Describe a subject you enjoyed studying at school.

You should say:

when and where you started studying it
what lessons were like
what made it different from other subjects
and explain why you enjoyed the subject.

Said: To be honest, I found school pretty challenging for a number of reasons. We moved house quite often back then, so I had to adapt to different teachers, learning expectations and to make new friends. However, the subject which I was always passionate about  and determined to succeed in was French.

I started lessons when I was quite young, which is common in the UK, as learning languages is actively encouraged, but the standard and expectation was relatively low so lessons revolved around role plays asking for ice cream or bread!  Our lessons involved a lot of writing and dictation which was hard, and I did struggle to see the point of this as what I really wanted to learn was how to communicate and be understood. Our vocabulary was based around the family, food, travel and school so It was quite useful but not the sort of things that children really want to talk about.

I was motivated as I had already visited France on holiday and so I could see for myself the possible benefits of being able to communicate and make myself understood. The breakthrough for me came when I was around 15 with a teacher called Mrs. Green.

She was half French herself, so she spoke beautifully and was rather glamourous too and her lessons were filled with laughter, games and stories although she was very strict as well. We were all expected to study hard and to succeed in exams. She was inspiring though because she loved her subject.

Personally, I have always enjoyed listening to languages, to the intonation and sound even if I do not understand. Once I could use the French I had learnt in school when I visited France and later studied there, the language came alive and all that hard work as a youngster paid off!

However, many league tables which rank schools in order of high exam results, have proved that single sex schools can be much better as there are less distractions and maybe students are more able to focus on learning and be proud of their achievements without having to compete with the opposite sex.

Many of these schools offer a wide range of extra-curricular activities such as golf, photography or fashion as well as the core academic subjects. Children usually speak of forming lifelong friendships, with their peer group as well as teachers and there is a strong concept of shared experiences.

#### Describe a job that would be classified as crucial or highly important

You should say:

what the job is
what the job involves
why it is important
Davido: There is no doubt in my mind that workers who dedicate themselves to the Health profession should be considered highly important or key. Not just in this recent COVID pandemic, but in all situations, day or night, local or global, we depend on nurses, doctors, consultants and medical professionals to diagnose, care for and cure us.

It\'s definitely not a career for the faint hearted and if you are after job flexibility or a dependable nine to five it\'s not the one for you. As an example, a friend of mine who had always been determined to be a Doctor, is currently practicing in at a London hospital and specialises in children\'s medicine or pediatrics. 

He is involved in the A and E department, so has to react swiftly and calmly in all kinds of worrying situations but always appear optimistic though, sadly he has often had to break bad news to families.

Of course, a career in Medicine is one of the most important there is as we are totally dependent on being able to get help when we need it, everything from routine check ups to specialist consultancies, operations and follow up care.

Of course, there has always been huge appreciation and acknowledgment for our doctors and nurses and this continues to grow. Whilst in many countries, medics are well paid, in others, the job is not lucrative, although there is no doubt that the gratitude the public feel towards medics is overwhelming.

#### Describe an experience  or meeting you had at university.

You should say:

what it was
when you had this experience or meeting
where you had this experience
and explain why this experience/ meeting  had an impact on you.

Sara: I would like to talk about my own personal experience studying at a further education college in Germany a few years ago. I had enrolled at a technical college, as I was looking for a practical, vocational course in order to learn more about engineering and I had hoped that this course would include an element of hands on training as well as formal classroom learning.

When I arrived at the college, I was allocated a place at a hall of residence which I had thought would be located close to the lecture theatres, however in fact, it was a 30 minute bus ride away. This was a disaster as far as making friends was concerned – it made it very hard to get involved in a university social life, which everyone knows is meant to be exciting and great fun.

At one of the seminars in our first month I explained my accommodation issue to one of my new tutors, a very kind professor who was one of the leading experts in her field, and she was very sympathetic, and fully understood that this hall of residence was located a long way from the student\'s union and other student areas.

Suddenly, while we were talking, her eyes lit up, like she had had an inspired idea! She explained that she was looking for a lodger or tenant as she lived in a large, empty house and she offered me the chance to rent a room in her house which I gratefully accepted.

For the next three years, I lived in central Berlin with this incredibly wise, kind and intelligent professor. She challenged and motivated me to study as hard as I could, as at one point I had considered dropping out because I was rather out of my depth in some of the technical detail of the course, and when I finally graduated, she was cheering the loudest at my graduation ceremony.

I was very lucky to have formed such a strong bond with this amazing teacher and the impact she had on me was life changing as now I intend to specialise in the same field as her.

#### Examiner: Is higher education too expensive in your country?

Alice: I think that it is very costly to go into higher education in my country. Prices rose dramatically a few years ago, making it extremely difficult for most people to afford it. Tuition fees are largely funded by loans which need to be repaid over a working life time, but while spending thousands on an education is worth every penny, it can, as a consequence, bring years of debt to a student and their family. In today\'s society, no one is guaranteed to get a good job straight after university, so these course fee debts often continue to follow them  around for life.

#### Examiner: What advantages do universities bring to society?

Bolore: I think that there are many positive things that universities or further education colleges can offer  communities and neighbourhoods around them. They bring students into the area for one, which means housing will be in demand. They will spend money on food, go out to eat and socialise and invest in books (new as well as second hand) for their course, making the town or city a buzzing hub of student life. The students themselves benefit from having a high level of education, which can then be translated into skills in the workplace, keeping society progressing and the economy profitable with their increased skills and knowledge.

#### Examiner: Which is more important, research or teaching?

Jon: This is an interesting debate which has come to the fore as the tuition fees for University are so high and students are demanding high quality contact time.  I think that for those students or potential Professors  who undertake  research, there is the need to complete  a Master\'s degree or a PhD. This can develop a further understanding of a subject and allow  graduates  to develop their research skills. Many people who complete these higher levels of education, also teach at University or College as a way of sharing their knowledge and gaining respect from their peers. It is not really possible to teach at that level without undertaking some sort of extensive research.

Maria: I was lucky to be brought up in a large family home which was where my grandparents lived before my parents. This ancestral home was seeped in family history and I have always felt a great attachment to it. It is far more spacious than the urban loft where I am now, with larger, airier rooms and inspiring panoramic views. The house has a large veranda where we share family meals, a study and a cellar where my father keeps his best wine.

#### Examiner: Have you ever shared a flat with people you did not know before?

Henri: Well, when I used to live in London, I could not afford to rent a place of my own, so I decided to join a flat share which I saw advertised on an accommodation website. It was a real challenge as the flat was in need of modernisation, and whilst the rooms boasted original features, such as original Victorian windows, it was freezing cold and my flatmates kept to themselves so it was hard to make friends.

#### Describe a house or an apartment that you would like to live in. You should say

What kind of accommodation it would be
where it would be
who would live there with you
and why you would enjoy living in this place
Caspar: I have always been attracted to the idea of constructing my own home, as my father is an architect and we have always been great fans of watching TV programmes which follow the trials and tribulations of people who are involved in complicated and ambitious building projects. Sometimes, although there are many difficulties and unexpected challenges along the way, the end resulting home is just beautiful, appealing and really inspiring.

This small house would be by the sea, possibly in France, as the Atlantic coastline there is still quite wild and underpopulated. I\'m attracted to the idea of an environmentally friendly bungalow, which would be open plan and use screens or bookshelves to divide rooms.

I\'d love to work with my father on the design, and ideally it would be made of eco-friendly materials, such as sustainable woods, recycled glass and highly insulated to keep energy costs as low as possible. I\'ve been inspired by the Scandinavian style houses I have seen in design magazines, which are planned to blend into their location, looking simple and clean from the outside, but boasting all mod cons inside.

I would love to have a large terrace to sit and watch the sunsets or share sustainably sourced local foods. I am not tempted by an extravagant, designer or flashy décor but prefer something understated with stripped or varnished wood floors, a kitchen made from recycled wood, and open shelves to display my collection of ceramic pottery which was my grandmothers. Light is very important to me, so I would try to incorporate large full length windows to enjoy the views and experience a connection to the peaceful countryside outside.

#### Examiner: In your country is it more common to rent or buy a house?

Sergi: Over the past twenty years there has been a surge in property prices, fuelled by relaxation in the rules surrounding mortgages and loans. This has resulted in a boom in the housing market. Many young professionals are taking the opportunity to get on the property ladder but for most first time buyers, many years of renting is needed to save enough for a deposit.

#### Examiner: Many landlords are known to take advantage of their tenants. What can be done to control this?

Raoul: It is well known that in many urban areas, which are overcrowded and where accommodation is in very short supply, that unscrupulous landlords charge excessive rents and demand large deposits which they are unlikely to return in full. Improved legal protection should be provided for tenants, many of whom are unaware of their rights, and this might give leaseholders more confidence and security.

It also depends on which neighbourhood you want to live in but the city centres have become too expensive for normal, middle income families or people to live there. Outside the centre, there are the new hipster neighbourhoods, where many creative or entrepreneurs and artists live, but there can be a shortage of family sized homes.

## IELTS speaking part 2 questions

#### Describe a book or a film that had a strong impact on you.

You should say:

• What was it

• When you read or saw it

• How it influenced you

And say if you liked it and why.

Eduardo: When I used to live in Paris as a teenager, I became rather obsessed with watching what might be called 'artistic' French films. My favourite was called Paris at Midnight and was directed by Louis Truffaut. Often he filmed in black and white and told a rather dark story – the genre could be described as black humour or drama, I suppose.

While many of my friends were happily absorbed in the latest James Bond movie or other rather commercial blockbusters,  I took pride in educating myself in the traditions of the French cinema and trying to learn a bit of French at the same time.

This film in particular had a lasting impression on me – I think in fact, it had been adapted from a best seller and since, it has inspired other cartoon spin-offs and series as well. The beautiful, mysterious heroine was both provocative and enchanting – it was impossible to predict how she would react in a situation, which kept the tension in the film very high. Added to this was a haunting musical score, written by a famous French musician, and this also became a top selling album in the charts.

This film, and others like it, inspired me to work harder on my French language skills and to really investigate the history and culture of Paris in greater depth. At the time, I would have said that I enjoyed it, but in hindsight, I think it was probably not a very relaxing watch, and today, I would opt for something less intellectual!

#### Examiner: Do you think people go to the cinema as much as they used to?

Sergi: No, and there has been a sea change in the way people chose to view films nowadays which has been reinforced by the recent pandemic when cinemas and theatres were closed. Even before this disaster, many film-goers had the option to pay for online streaming of the latest releases via the internet so they could enjoy the thrills of the cinema but without leaving their sofas. Companies like Netflix and Amazon have led the way in this new trend and now commission films and drama series of their own.

#### Examiner: Should art still play a role in education for students at school, as well as books and films?

Raoul: It is true that for many young adults and school children art is not part of their usual education, and they are only able to access an understanding of great, historic and influential paintings if they study art. Many educators argue that art should play as big a role as the appreciation of books or film in the curriculum as art offers an equally valid perspective on a country\'s cultural background and heritage.

#### Examiner: What do you think about e-books?

Alline: In my opinion, paperback or hardback books are much better and reading a book from an e-reader just doesn\'t feel the same for me. Many readers value the sensation of turning pages and that special smell of paper. I think that the look and feel of a book can never be replaced by an e-reader, but I understand usefulness of electronic books. It is very convenient to be able to carry hundreds of books in your pocket especially when travelling or studying.

#### Describe a person you know who is doing something to protect the environment

You should say

Who this person is
What this person is doing to protect the environment
How easy/difficult it is for him/her to do this
And explain how you feel about what this person is doing to protect the environment

Asha: I think everyone nowadays is doing their part to some degree to protect the environment but one person I know really does more than her fair share. This is my friend Eva, who is more eco-conscious than most people I think.

When we were in school, Eva campaigned to get a compost bin placed in our school yard so that the gardening club would have natural fertilizer. She was very concerned about chemical fertilizers contaminating groundwater.

Students, parents and teachers brought their vegetable scraps to be composted and it worked! We had an endless supply of non-chemical compost for our garden. She started using reusable cups and bottles long before they were popular and I don\'t think I have ever seen her carry a plastic bag.

Nowadays, she is part of a neighborhood clean- up group that removes rubbish from our local parks and beaches. She grows organic vegetables in her garden and commutes to work with her bicycle every day. Her house uses solar panels for heating and she even makes her own household cleaning products.

Eva never complains about these activities being time-consuming or difficult; she just feels she is doing what she can to be environmentally conscious. So, Eva is a person not doing just one thing to protect the environment, but in fact following a green lifestyle in order to live more sustainably. I admire her and her efforts and she is truly a role model for all of us to try to emulate.

#### What are some things ordinary people can do to protect the environment?

Andre: There are small and more significant actions people can take to protect the environment. Whenever there is a choice between a conventional product or more environmentally friendly one, we should always choose the latter. Light bulbs is one small example. The energy saving ones might be a little more expensive but the benefits are worth it.

We also need to think about some of our other choices that contribute to fuel emissions. Switching to hybrid or electric cars is one obvious answer but what about air travel in general? What about the products we consume? We need to think about the food miles behind what we eat and make every effort to eat local food.

#### What are some ways in which industries damage the environment?

Sophie: Unfortunately, industries destroy the environment in a variety of ways. Factories use fossil fuels to run machines and the smoke and carbon monoxide released lead to air pollution. Factories dispose of their waste in nearby waterways, creating water pollution.

This in turn affects the entire ecosystem as sea animals and the birds and other animals that eat them suffer as a result. Even the noise from industries affect the environment. Many animals abandon their natural habitat once a factory is built, creating an imbalance in the ecosystem.

#### Do you believe that international cooperation is necessary to solve environmental problems?

Emile: I think international cooperation is the only way to tackle environmental issues. It is meaningless if one country takes measures to protect the environment, but its neighbor does not.

There must be a collective effort around the world where leaders agree to the steps that must be taken. While there are many companies globally that are trying to be more green to make true progress an international agreement must be forged.

A writer can work either in an office or remotely. One day you might be writing from Paris and the next day from New York! Your office is wherever you are and thanks to modern technology, telecommuting works like a breeze!

Furthermore, you\'re not tied to a desk 9 to 5. A writer can create a schedule that works for him or her. Personally, I am a night owl so I like working late into the night – you couldn\'t do that in an office job!

Jorge: Working from home does have a number of sustainability benefits. When employees work from home, there is a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions from cars, so in that sense, working from home is environmentally friendly.

Also, everything must be done electronically – so there\'s no unnecessary waste of paper by printing work documents. Plus, businesses can move into smaller spaces that use fewer resources like heat, water and electricity, so it\'s also really financially viable.

Salima: To be honest, it can be a challenge to feel motivated when you are working without any supervision so it\'s easy to slack off and some employees might not want that.

Another issue is that there is no separation of your home and work life so that might lead to burnout.

In some professions, working from home is difficult because they may not have the office equipment required to do their job properly. Of course, we can\'t forget the social component of the workplace which is paramount for lots of people.

#### Examiner: How do you predict work will change in the future?

This would involve working both from home and from an office on certain days of the week, for certain functions, like meetings or events.

If this does happen, I think it will be a wonderful development as it really embraces the needs of the employee as an individual, different personal obligations, working styles, timetables and so on.

We\'re realizing the Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 model does not fit everyone so I think embracing hybrid work more will give people the autonomy to create a work schedule that works for them, resulting in higher productivity and happier employees – and happier companies.

#### Talk about your favorite social media site or application

Say when you first used it

Why you use it 
How often you use it 
And if you recommend it to others
While many people my age have moved on to Snapchat or TikTok, Instagram remains my favorite social media site for a variety of reasons. I started using this app five years ago when I started experimenting with photography and I find that it is an application that allows me to express myself creatively, by using various filters for my photography or videos to create an effect I desire.

I have accumulated a rather large number of followers over the years, but I certainly would not call myself an influencer. I now use the application at least 3 times a week to post stories or to dm my friends and followers.

I still enjoy using Instagram very much and would absolutely recommend it to others ….but you do need to have thick skin if you amass a large following. I have had people make derogatory comments to me which can be rather upsetting but fortunately you can block them easily. I have been fortunate so far, but some people I know have been victims of catfishing, which can be traumatic.

So the bully gets the validation he or she needs without any of the repercussions that might occur if the bullying were to take place in the real world.

#### Examiner: Do you remember any adverts you saw when you were younger?

Lena: Oh certainly! I remember a dollhouse that was featured for quite some time on television but I also remember commercials for adult products like bath soap or beer. I can\'t really say what was so memorable about these commercials – perhaps the imagery or the jingle, but years later I most definitely remember them.

#### Examiner: Do you often buy things after seeing an advert?

Sonya: Sometimes I do, yes. If I believe that a product satisfies a particular need I have, then I may purchase it. Sometimes, in the case of food, the products displayed are so tantalizing that you may try the product just to see if it lives up to its hype.

#### Examiner: Do you like it when celebrities advertise products?

Sandeep: No, actually I don\'t. I think celebrity endorsements cheapen the celebrity and insult the public\'s intelligence. It\'s fairly obvious that the celebrity is advertising the product only to earn a large amount of money and quite frankly, even if he or she does use the product, that does not automatically mean the product is right for me or will make me more similar to the celebrity.

What is even worse than celebrity endorsements is when you see product placements in movies. There have been times when a soft drink was so prominently displayed on the screen that it was laughable. These types of ads repel me rather than attract me.

## IELTS speaking part 2 (sample cue card)

#### Describe an advert you saw recently. You should say:

What the product/ service was
Where you saw it
How was the product/ advertised
And how you felt about it
Leyla: To be honest, I don\'t watch a lot of television although it is on in my house rather often. Lately, I have repeatedly heard adverts for a brand of cheese available in my country. I say I ”heard” them because it was the music that has stuck out in my mind. The commercial uses a folk song throughout the commercial that I find rather grating.

It\'s the kind of jingle – and commercial that makes me want to change the channel immediately!!! However, I think that this kind of advertising is very effective; if you like the song then you may be more inclined to purchase the product. If though you are like me and don\'t like the song, then the ad is still successful because it has gotten my attention!

#### Examiner: Do you think advertising will change in the future?

Shahla: I think advertising is probably one of the fastest changing industries today. It must always adapt and find new ways of getting the attention of potential customers without turning them off. I think several years ago we could have in no way imagined how important Youtube or Facebook would be for advertisers so I believe in the future we will see more changes as more apps and sites become popular.

#### Examiner: How is advertising different now in relation to the past?

Minnie: Advertising in the past relied more heavily on print, like magazines, newspapers and billboards. I can\'t recall the last time I noticed a billboard while driving. Radio too is less important and maybe a great medium for local products and services. I believe TV ads remain very popular but advertising on the internet has really taken over. We are bombarded with so many adverts online that I don\'t think we even notice them anymore.

#### Examiner: Some people think it is unethical to advertise to children. Do you agree?

Rana: Apparently, in some countries children are a very powerful market with considerable buying power! So, it only makes sense that advertisers would want to advertise to them. However, this must be done extremely carefully. In my country there are laws forbidding advertisers from advertising toys when cartoons are playing.

In my husband\'s country though it is a free-for-all where commercials during Saturday morning cartoons promote toys, unhealthy snacks, theme parks – anything and everything that a child could – and undoubtedly does- ask for! Children are very impressionable so yes, it does seem unethical although with such financial strength I can understand why advertisers are tempted.

#### Examiner: Do you enjoy shopping?

Archie: I do enjoy shopping – perhaps more than I should! My friends say that I am something of a clothes horse! I like to be well put together but I typically wait for the sales though so that I can pick up what I want at a bargain price. 

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Examiner: What things do you like shopping for?

Esther: Like many women my age, I enjoy shopping for clothes and accessories. I try to be up on the latest trends, so first I scan my social media feed for what\'s in fashion and I try to replicate the looks with the lower priced items I buy – at a fraction of the cost of what influencers pay!

<div align="right">

#### Examiner: Do you prefer to shop alone or with other people?

Sonya: If I have to buy something for an important function, then I typically bring my mother with me because she has a great eye for clothes. She knows what cut and style suits me. However, if I just want to pass the time, then I prefer going alone, especially in the morning when the shops are less crowded. I like inspecting the clothes racks or shoe displays.

#### Describe a shop you like going to say:

 where the shop is
what things it sells
how often you go there
and why you like shopping there
Samantha: The shop I like going to is one that I don\'t visit very often as it is extremely expensive but whenever I have gone, I have enjoyed the experience very much. The shop is in the center of the city in a beautiful neoclassical building with a spiral staircase.

There are large velvet sofas where you can rest while you are served. When you walk through the double doors, a shop assistant greets you and offers coffee and tea. They are very friendly and really try to get to know the customer.

Usually, I would find this level of attention from a shop person irritating, but here they do it in such a way that you feel they are really trying to accommodate you. The shop sells luxury goods from high-end designers. Many people feel their items are overpriced but I guess there is a market for these goods.

As I said, I don\'t go their often – it is out of my price range – but I did go when my brother was getting married to look for shoes. The selection and quality of their goods are incomparable – from over-the-top avantgarde designer items to classics that can become family heirlooms.

So it is the combination of factors – the store ambience, the unparalleled customer service and of course, the top-notch products – that make this a store I enjoy shopping at. I hope that one day I will be able to afford to shop there on a regular basis.

## IELTS speaking part 3 sample answer

#### Some people think women shop more than men. Do you think this is true?

Paolo: Generally there seems to be some truth to this. I know some men who like to keep up with the latest fashions and are capable of blowing enormous sums of money on “it” sneakers and jeans, but on the whole, shopping seems to be a pastime more favored by women.

Firstly, I think society places more pressure on women to have an attractive and modern appearance, so to stay current, they have to update their look regularly. The fashion industry knows this, of course, and as a result the selection women have to choose from is infinite. It\'s not like men\'s clothes where your choice of trouser colors is black, grey or blue!

#### How is shopping different now compared to how it was in the past?

Gunther: Well, first of all, today we are spoilt for choice. Thanks to globalization, you no longer have to go to France to buy French goods, for example. In my city, on the high street we have brands from Spain, Italy, France, China and Japan.

This was unfathomable a few decades ago. A new element in shopping is also e-shops. These have made the items of your choices accessible with the click of a button, regardless of the location. The items arrive at your doorstep, sometimes even on the same day.

<div align="right">

#### How do you think shopping will change in the future?

Ollie: It\'s difficult to say. I think technology will take the online shopping experience to a whole new level. For example, shopping will soon become even more personalized. Some sites today can recommend the best size for you based on information you provide.

I am certain that in the future this will be done merely by sending an image of yourself and the item will be superimposed on your frame! I imagine shipping will be even more efficient so that you won\'t have to wait a week for your item to arrive.

I also suspect digital imagery online will improve so that you can truly understand the details of the item you are purchasing. As far as in person shopping is concerned, brick and mortar stores will have a tough time competing with their online counterparts so the experience will have to become more efficient and more enjoyable.
